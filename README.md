# beacon-models

**NO SUPPORT AS OF MAY 19**

We moved the TypeScript interfaces and the schema-inspector schemas into the `gb-tracker-client` repo (https://github.com/groupby/gb-tracker-client) directly. This repo and its NPM package `@groupby/beacon-models` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@groupby/beacon-models) should no longer be used.
